## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm RJ Wiechecki — a hands-on IT professional transitioning into Cybersecurity and Network Engineering with a special focus on medical IoT systems. I build tools that simplify real-world workflows, automate the repetitive, and prioritize accessibility for end-users and hiring managers alike.

🔍 My interests:
- Ethical hacking & system hardening  
- Secure remote access + VPN architectures  
- Node.js automation scripts for career workflows  
- Clinical-grade monitoring devices and low-power IoT  
- Building meaningful tech with a human-first mindset

🛠️ Projects include:
- **Workday Form Autofill Helper**: A Node-powered script to extract structured resume content for pasting into Workday applications — one field at a time.
- Raspberry Pi SOC Lab (SSH + VPN-ready)
- Automation tools for KDP reports and resume rendering

🎯 Mission: Make tech that *serves* — not overwhelms.
